todo 

project settings:
- Merge requests: Merge commit with semi-linear history   uitgezet!!!!! TODO
- Merge options: uncheck Enable "Delete source branch" option by default
squish always

After merge (branch to master) on GitLab: 
- update local master: branches pulldown | Recent | master | Update
- update local branche: branches pulldown | Recent | master | Merge master into branch



****** Branches

Idee beter om steeds een nieuwe branch te maken !!!
En na enkele versies verder op te ruimen

Idea to discuss: let's use for each major contribution a new branch
After 'some time' cleanup branches

Sync local branch with gitlab master: (like after merge (branch to master) on GitLab or before making Merge Request): 
- update local master: branches pulldown | Recent | master | Update
- update local branch: branches pulldown | Recent | master | Merge master into branch  [DO NOT use rebase]

Rob, Moustafa and Jaap working on own branch in PyCharm:
- clone project
- create new branch
  Git | New Branch
  branch name = Rob/Moustafa/Jaap
  check out branch
- Change code
- Commit and Push (as usually)
- Sync local branch with gitlab master
- run successfully regression tests
- click on Create Merge Request in Notifications (right bottom) in PyCharm
  (Alternative Login GitLab and use branch name:
  Left column | code | Merge requests | Create merge request
  (NOTE: do NOT delete source branch when accepted (at bottom of window))
- Sync local branch with gitlab master

- Note switch between master and branches by selecting in 2nd task balk  2nd field
  use drop down menu, select branch from recent and checkout

Merge branch in master GitLab
  Login GitLab master branch
  Left bar | Code | Merge requests | select name of request (branch name)
  edit commit message with new version nr in Squash msg and do merge
  Sync local branch with gitlab master
  (Note do not use Pycharm to merge, because commit mesage can not be changed)
