# OpenRC4CL



Low-cost DIY project for expanding CL handles with RC functions like throttle control, servos, timers, telemetry and failsafe.
Uses the ESP-NOW protocol transmitted via the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band.



Software is released under the MIT licence.



Note this project is Work In Progress and is develloped for ESP32 C6.



Feedback is welcome and I am open for ideas and/or colaboration.
