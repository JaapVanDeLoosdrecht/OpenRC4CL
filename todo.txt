Todo:
- cleanup libraries, add Serial_BLE to git
- remove timer from Rx???
- implement new pin allocations
- class Status, change WaitTxRx to WaitConnection
- class DipSwitch for max 4 pins
- CLTimer: 
  Beeper warning signal N secs before starting engine
  Abort starting sequence and running with button
- add list with functionality in readme
- softstart option for CLtimer and combat handle
  rampup time if starting from zero
- first use powerbank as powersupply for Tx, replace later with lipo
- first Tx test on combat handle with killswitch and throttle dail on top of handle

protype board:
- mark servo and VBatt headers with heat-shrink tubing

fase2:
- use 2 dipswitches to select 4 different wifi channel nrs in Rx and Tx
- exponential throttle
- soft mac address
- (paper display on TX)
- use BT to send setting commands

(fase 3:
- use IMU as crash sensor to kill engine
