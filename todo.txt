Todo:
- Change Led to class Blink for both leds and beepers
  add (pin, pulse, dutyF)  dutyF for leds = 2
  addLed(pin, pulse)
  addBeeper(pin, pulse, dutyF)
  No list possible
  In constructor specify max Blinks
  One update for all Blinks
- lipo monitoring and low bat, 100K + 10K for max 8S + 1N4001 (correct for 0.7V drop)
  make setup with V divider using R for max 6S (or use 1 lipo only)
  use Schottky diode for protection?? and compensate diode loss in calculation
- Beepers
  CLTimer: warning signal N secs before starting engine
  Rx: warning signal when ThrHold switches off
  Tx: warning when ThrHold is off when powering up
- add list with functionality in readme
- softstart option for CLtimer and combat handle
  rampup time if starting from zero
- active buzzer on Tx
- first use powerbank as powersupply for Tx, replace later with lipo
- first Tx test on combat handle with killswitch and throttle dail on top of handle

fase2:
- use 4 dipswitch te select channel nr in Rx and Tx
- add max time functionality to Tx buzzer ??? (optional timer on Rx, frees an analog input on Rx)
- exponential throttle
- soft mac address
- paper display on TX
- use IMU as crash sensor to kill engine
- use the BluetoothSerial.h for logging with Bluetooth Terminal App (Google play)
