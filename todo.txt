Todo:
- lipo monitoring and low bat, 100K + 10K for max 8S + 1N4001 (correct for 0.7V drop)
  make setup with V divider using R for max 6S (or use 1 lipo only)
  use Schottky diode for protection?? and compensate diode loss in calculation
- use the BluetoothSerial.h for logging with Bluetooth Terminal App (Google play)

- Beeper
  CLTimer: warning signal N secs before starting engine
- add list with functionality in readme
- softstart option for CLtimer and combat handle
  rampup time if starting from zero
- first use powerbank as powersupply for Tx, replace later with lipo
- first Tx test on combat handle with killswitch and throttle dail on top of handle

fase2:
- use 4 dipswitch te select channel nr in Rx and Tx
- exponential throttle
- soft mac address
- paper display on TX
- use IMU as crash sensor to kill engine

(fase 3:
- governor for throttle)

Changed:
- Base class Blink for Led and Beep added
- Beeper added
- Tx: warning when ThrHold is off when powering up
- if Rx restarts Tx should reset beep_end_flight
- added chan2 and chan3
