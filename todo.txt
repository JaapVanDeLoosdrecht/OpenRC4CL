Todo:
- add to class Throttle EscWarn to dis/en_able Esc throttle warning
- add vbatt and low vbatt to telemetry, vbatt < low vbatt -> buzzer
- add beep warning:  no TH -> Rx on -> feedback telemetry -> Tx beep
- class DipSwitch for max 4 pins
- remove timer from Rx is NOT possible, timer is needed for failsave
  new Failsafe throttle implemenation: always for 2(?) sec toggle 0.5 sec to half power and than TH, no need for timer only wall clock
- CLTimer: 
  Beeper warning signal N secs before starting engine
  Abort starting sequence and running with button
- softstart option for CLtimer and combat handle
  rampup time if starting from zero
- first use powerbank as powersupply for Tx, replace later with lipo
- first Tx test on combat handle with killswitch and throttle dail on top of handle

protype board:
- mark servo and VBatt headers with heat-shrink tubing

fase2:
- use 2 dipswitches to select 4 different wifi channel nrs in Rx and Tx
- exponential throttle
- soft mac address
- (paper display on TX)
- use BT to send setting commands

(fase 3:
- use IMU as crash sensor to kill engine
- governor for throttle

- idea measure freq zero crossing
)

Changed:
- remove max thr from Rx, have always on pot meter on Tx also for combat
- display Tx log TH and Thr value before telemetry
- Rx to TH if Rx turned on and first msg (after checksum check) is not TH
  leave this mode after TH is received from Tx
- added PIN_NOT_USED and default action for all sensors and actuators 
- new struct Status
