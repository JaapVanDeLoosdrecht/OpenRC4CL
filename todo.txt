Todo:
- test if drop is constant [1..8]S
  lipo monitoring and low bat, 100K + 10K for max 8S + 1N4001 (correct for 0.7V drop)
  make setup with V divider using R for max 6S (or use 1 lipo only)
  NOTE test first with 3.3V
- use the BluetoothSerial.h for logging with Bluetooth Terminal App (Google play)
